# Adyen Online Payment Integration Demos

This repository includes a collection of PCI-compliant UI integrations that show how to integrate with Adyen using different payment methods. 
The demos below leverages Adyen's API Library for Node.js ([GitHub](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-node-api-library) | [Documentation](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/libraries)).


## [Checkout Example](checkout-example)
The [checkout example](checkout-example) repository includes examples of PCI-compliant UI integrations for online payments with Adyen.
Within this demo app, you'll find a simplified version of an e-commerce website, complete with commented code to highlight key features and concepts of Adyen's API.
Check out the underlying code to see how you can integrate Adyen to give your shoppers the option to pay with their preferred payment methods, all in a seamless checkout experience.

## [Subscription Example](subscription-example)
The [subscription example](subscription-example) repository includes a tokenization example for subscriptions. Within this demo app, you'll find a simplified version of a website that offers a music subscription service.
The shopper can purchase a subscription and administrators can manage the saved (tokenized) payment methods on a separate admin panel.
The panel allows admins to make payments on behalf of the shopper using this token.
