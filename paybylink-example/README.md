# Adyen [Pay By Link](https://docs.adyen.com/unified-commerce/pay-by-link) Integration Demo

This repository includes an example of Pay By Link with Adyen.
Within this demo app, you can create links by specifying the amount. The shopper can then choose to accept the links and complete the payment.

This demo leverages Adyen's API Library for Node.js ([GitHub](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-node-api-library) | [Docs](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/libraries#javascript)).

> **Note:** We've included a [blog post](https://www.adyen.com/blog/pay-by-link-for-developers) that explains Pay By Link in detail.


## Run this integration in seconds using [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)

* Open your [Adyen Test Account](https://ca-test.adyen.com/ca/ca/overview/default.shtml) and create a set of [API keys](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key).
* Go to [gitpod account variables](https://gitpod.io/variables).
* Set the `ADYEN_API_KEY`, `ADYEN_HMAC_KEY` and `ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT variables`.
* Click the button below!

## Testing webhooks

Webhooks deliver asynchronous notifications and it is important to test them during the setup of your integration. You can find more information about webhooks in [this detailed blog post](https://www.adyen.com/blog/Integrating-webhooks-notifications-with-Adyen-Checkout).

This sample application provides a simple webhook integration exposed at `/api/webhooks/notifications`. For it to work, you need to:

1. Provide a way for the Adyen platform to reach your running application
2. Add a Standard webhook in your Customer Area

### Making your server reachable

Your endpoint that will consume the incoming webhook must be publicly accessible.

There are typically 3 options:
* deploy on your own cloud provider
* deploy on Gitpod
* expose your localhost with tunneling software (i.e. ngrok)

#### Option 1: cloud deployment
If you deploy on your cloud provider (or your own public server) the webhook URL will be the URL of the server 
```
  https://{cloud-provider}/api/webhooks/notifications
```

#### Option 2: Gitpod
If you use Gitpod the webhook URL will be the host assigned by Gitpod
```
  https://myorg-myrepo-y8ad7pso0w5.ws-eu75.gitpod.io/api/webhooks/notifications
```
**Note:** when starting a new Gitpod workspace the host changes, make sure to **update the Webhook URL** in the Customer Area

#### Option 3: localhost via tunneling software
If you use a tunneling service like [ngrok](ngrok) the webhook URL will be the generated URL (ie `https://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io`)

```bash
  $ ngrok http 8080
  
  Session Status                online                                                                                           
  Account                       ############                                                                      
  Version                       #########                                                                                          
  Region                        United States (us)                                                                                 
  Forwarding                    http://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080                                       
  Forwarding                    https://c991-80-113-16-28.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8080           
```

**Note:** when restarting ngrok a new URL is generated, make sure to **update the Webhook URL** in the Customer Area

### Set up a webhook

* In the Customer Area go to Developers -> Webhooks and create a new 'Standard notification' webhook.
* Enter the URL of your application/endpoint (see options [above](#making-your-server-reachable))
* Define username and password for Basic Authentication
* Generate the HMAC Key
* Make sure the webhook is **Enabled** (therefore it can receive the notifications)

That's it! Every time you perform a new payment, your application will receive a notification from the Adyen platform.

## Usage

1. Visit the main page and create a link.

2. Use the link to finalize the payment.

3. Visit the Customer Area â†’ `Pay By-Link`.
