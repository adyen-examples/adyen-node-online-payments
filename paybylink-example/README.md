# Description

This repository includes an example of Pay By Link with Adyen.
Within this demo app, you can create links by specifying the amount. The shopper can then choose to accept the links and complete the payment.

This demo leverages Adyen's API Library for Node.js ([GitHub](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-node-api-library) | [Docs](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/libraries#javascript)).

> **Note:** We've included a [blog post](https://www.adyen.com/blog/pay-by-link-for-developers) that explains Pay By Link in detail.

## Requirements

- [Adyen API Credentials](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials/)
- Node.js 20+

## 1. Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-node-online-payments.git
```

## 2. Set the environment variables
* [API key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/how-to-get-the-api-key)
* [Client Key](https://docs.adyen.com/user-management/client-side-authentication)
* [Merchant Account](https://docs.adyen.com/account/account-structure)
* [HMAC Key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/verify-hmac-signatures)

Create a `./.env` file with the environment variables. 
```shell
export ADYEN_API_KEY=yourAdyenApiKey
export ADYEN_MERCHANT_ACCOUNT=yourAdyenMerchantAccount
export ADYEN_CLIENT_KEY=yourAdyenClientKey
export ADYEN_HMAC_KEY=yourHmacKey
```

## 3. Run the application

```
cd paybylink-example
    
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to create a Payment Link.


# Webhooks

Webhooks deliver asynchronous notifications about the payment status and other events that are important to receive and process. 
You can find more information about webhooks in [this blog post](https://www.adyen.com/knowledge-hub/consuming-webhooks).

### Webhook setup

In the Customer Area under the `Developers â†’ Webhooks` section, [create](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/#set-up-webhooks-in-your-customer-area) a new `Standard webhook`.

A good practice is to set up basic authentication, copy the generated HMAC Key and set it as an environment variable. The application will use this to verify the [HMAC signatures](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/webhooks/verify-hmac-signatures/).

Make sure the webhook is **enabled**, so it can receive notifications.

### Expose an endpoint

This demo provides a simple webhook implementation exposed at `/api/webhooks/notifications` that shows you how to receive, validate and consume the webhook payload.

### Test your webhook

The following webhooks `events` should be enabled:
* **AUTHORISATION**

To make sure that the Adyen platform can reach your application, we have written a [Webhooks Testing Guide](https://github.com/adyen-examples/.github/blob/main/pages/webhooks-testing.md)
that explores several options on how you can easily achieve this (e.g. running on localhost or cloud).
